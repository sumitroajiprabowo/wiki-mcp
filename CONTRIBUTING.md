# Contributing to wiki-mcp

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- npm

## Dev Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumitroajiprabowo/wiki-mcp.git
cd wiki-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Type Checking

```bash
npm run lint
```

This runs `tsc --noEmit` and reports any type errors without emitting output files.

## Adding a New Tool

1. Create a handler file in `src/tools/`, for example `src/tools/my-tool.ts`. Export a handler function and its input schema.

2. Register the tool in `src/tools/index.ts` by importing your handler and adding it to the tool registry.

3. Add a corresponding test file in `tests/tools/my-tool.test.ts`. Cover at least the happy path and one error case.

4. Run `npm run lint && npm test` to verify everything passes before opening a PR.
